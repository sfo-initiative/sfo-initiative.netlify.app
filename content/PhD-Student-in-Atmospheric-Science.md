Subject description
Atmospheric science deals with research on the atmosphere of Earth and other planets by modelling along with development and use of instruments for remote sensing and in situ observations. Special focus is on the atmosphere's dynamical, chemical, and physical processes, as well as better weather and climate predictions.

Project description
You will be welcomed into an expanding group of researchers in Luleå University of Technology’s Division of Space Technology, in the atmospheric sciences subject. Our research topics include mass and energy fluxes within planets and their atmospheres, as well as snow, ice, and dirt in terrestrial and space environments. Researchers in Kiruna develop instruments for use on the ground, on balloons and on spacecraft and analyse data from Earth-observing satellites and deep space probes.

With the use of high-resolution satellite images, we want to determine areas affected by industrial pollution, by measuring spatial variations in the spectral albedo of snow. The spectral reflectivity of snow during springtime is determined by a combination of the snowpack properties and the amount of pollutants on and within the snow.  Satellite-borne multispectral imagers cover several channels in the visible and near infrared that are sensitive to variations in the reflectivity of snow. Reflectivity changes as a result of melting processes and the pollution load. The analysis of satellite images will be supported by field-site measurements of snow properties, radiative conditions, albedo and pollution load. Additionally, in a dedicated ice laboratory, optical properties, melting behaviour and the dependence on pollution on and inside a snowpack will be examined in a controlled environment.

The datasets from satellite analysis are expected to provide an improved overview on areas that are potentially affected by pollution, not only from dust and soot, but even agents that are more critical for the sensitive arctic environment.  Also, this can provide a tool for international authorities to monitor mining activities in sensitive areas with long-lasting snow cover.

Duties
As a PhD student you are expected to perform both experimental and theoretical work within your research studies as well as communicate your results at national and international conferences and in scientific journals. Most of your working time will be devoted to your own research studies.

In collaboration with your supervisors, you will participate in the following activities.
- Processing and analysis of satellite data;
- planning, setup and testing of laboratory experiments;
- planning, setup and testing of field experiments;
- dissemination of results at international conferences and in scientific publications.

In addition to learning and improving your skills while working with these duties, you will conduct literature reviews and read courses as part of your graduate education. Optionally, you may engage in teaching and other departmental duties, limited to a maximum of one year of the total period not exceeding five years.

Qualifications
We are looking for you who are enthusiastic and who have experience of working independently and as a member of a team. You must have a master’s degree or equivalent in meteorology, (geo)physics, environmental sciences or another related subject, such as e.g. quantitative geosciences. It is meritorious if you have experience designing & running experiments and analysing experimental data, ideally complemented with some knowledge of numerical simulations. Some knowledge of remote sensing will be an asset. You must be an effective communicator and fluent in English.
