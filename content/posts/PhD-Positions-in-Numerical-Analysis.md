University of Tübingen, Technical University of Munich

The numerical analysis groups at the University of Tübingen and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) welcome applications for two PhD positions (75%, German salary level E13, duration up to four years), one at each institution but with strong interaction between the two sites intended.

The DFG funded positions will be co-supervised by Prof. Caroline Lasser in Munich and Prof. Christian Lubich in Tübingen and are part of the newly created Collaborative Research Center “Mathematics of Many Body Quantum Systems and Their Collective Phenomena” between the LMU and TUM in Munich, and the University of Tübingen. 

The research project will focus on numerical methods for quantum many-body systems, specifically on time integration with gaussian and tensor-based methods. The PhD students will learn the existing extensions of the time-dependent variational principle, transfer them to gaussian and tensor-based approximations, analyse the new methods and apply them to concrete quantum dynamical systems of interest. This is a mathematical project: the numerical methods are the object of research and not just a given tool to be used in applications.

Ideal candidates have

    an excellent master's degree in mathematics,
    a strong background in numerical analysis,
    experience in numerical programming with Python or Matlab or Julia or C/C++,
    good command of the English language (knowledge of German is not required).

The two 75% positions carry no teaching load. The starting date is flexible. In exceptional cases, candidates with a doctoral degree in mathematics will be considered for a full E13 postdoc position.
Applications should be sent via email to both classer@ma.tum.de and lubich@na.uni-tuebingen.de as a single PDF document.Please state “Application: Quantum Systems” in the subject line.

Applications should include: CV, copies of degrees / university transcripts, a motivational statement (at most one page) explaining the applicant’s interest in the position as well as their relevant skills and experience, names and email addresses of two professors that may provide letters of recommendation directly to the hiring committee. 

Applicants may, but need not indicate if one of the two locations is preferred. A priori, every application received is considered for either of the two positions.

Review of applications will begin on January 31, 2023. Applications received after this date will still be considered if the position is not yet filled.

The Technical University of Munich and the University of Tübingen are equal opportunity employers. As such, applications from women are explicitly encouraged. Preference will be given to candidates with disabilities who have essentially the same qualifications.
