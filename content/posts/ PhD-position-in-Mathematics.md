The Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics at Umeå University is opening a PhD position in mathematics, with a focus on discrete mathematics. The position covers four years of third-cycle studies, including participation in research and third-cycle courses. The last day to apply is February 7, 2023. 

Project description and tasks
The PhD student will carry out research within discrete mathematics, as part of a Swedish Research Council-funded project with a focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem and will be supervised by Gerold Jäger. 

The aim of the project is the development of novel algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem and will include both practical implementations of heuristic algorithms based on sensitivity analysis and theoretical research. 

Currently, the research group in discrete mathematics consists of 18 persons. The group is very active and has a weekly seminar, different workshops, and a frequent flow of visitors and international collaborators. We have several PhD students and postdocs. Our research covers a wide range of areas and touches upon extremal, probabilistic, algorithmic, game theoretic, computational, topological, geometric and algebraic combinatorics.

Qualifications
The doctoral student will be admitted for studies at third-cycle level in Mathematics. To fulfil the general entry requirements, the applicant must have qualifications equivalent to a completed degree at second-cycle level or completed course requirements of at least 240 ECTS credits, including at least 60 ECTS credits at second-cycle level. 

To fulfil the specific entry requirements to be admitted for studies at third-cycle level in mathematics, the applicant is required to have completed at least 60 ECTS credits within the field of mathematics, of which at least 15 ECTS credits shall have been acquired at second-cycle level. Applicants who have acquired largely equivalent skills in some other system, either within Sweden or abroad, are also eligible. 

Required is a theoretical background in discrete mathematics and combinatorial optimization, as well as good programming skills (preferably C++). Good communication skills in both written and spoken English is also a requirement.

You are expected to take on an active role in this project and institutional work. You have a scientific mindset, can work independently, and are structured, flexible and solution-oriented. Above all, you are determined to continuously develop your skills and contribute to discrete mathematics research.

Applications will be assessed by the applicant’s qualifications and ability to benefit from the doctoral education they will receive.

About the position
The position is intended to result in a doctoral degree. The main task of doctoral students is to pursue their third-cycle studies, including active participation in research and third-cycle courses. The duties may include teaching or other departmental work, although duties of this kind may not comprise more than 20 percent of a full-time post. The employment is for a fixed term of four years full-time or up to five years when teaching part-time. Salary is set according to the salary ladder for PhD positions at Umeå University. Employment commences in the spring 2023 or by agreement. 

Application
Applications will be accepted via our recruitment system by February 7, 2023. Log in and apply via the button at the bottom of the page. The application must include the following documents written in English or Swedish:

    A cover letter briefly describing your qualifications and research interests, an explanation of why you are applying for the position and why you feel your qualifications and experience are relevant (not more than 3 pages).
    Curriculum vitae.
    Authenticated copies of degree certificates, diplomas or equivalent, including documentation of completed academic courses, received grades, and other certificates.
    Copies of relevant work such as master’s thesis or articles you have authored or co-authored. If the master’s thesis has not been completed before the application deadline, a summary of the master’s thesis project shall be included. The summary can, at most be five pages, including figures and references.
    Your GMAT (or GRE) and TOEFL/IELTS test scores if available.
    Contact details for at least two reference persons.

The Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics values the qualities that gender balance brings to the department, and therefore we particularly encourage female applicants.

Pursuant to Chapter 12 Section 2 of the Swedish Higher Education Ordinance (SFS 1993:100), the decision regarding the position cannot be appealed.
