The differential geometry group at the ULB is looking to recruit a PhD student with full funding for 4 years, with no associated teaching duties. Funding is also available to support travel to conferences and workshops. The position may be started after 01.04.2023 and preferably before 01.10.2023.

The differential geometry group at the ULB is a dynamic research group with an excellent international reputation and a lively community of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. The members of the group have extensive collaborations and links with other research institutions from around the globe. The group is active in Riemannian geometry, symplectic geometry, gauge theory and geometric analysis. ULB features an excellent mathematics department providing a stimulating research environment.

As a PhD student you will carry out mathematical research in the context of the research project "Topological methods in enumerative geometry of G2 manifolds" funded jointly by FNRS and DFG. You will be based in Brussels and work with Andriy Haydys and cosupervised by Sebastian Goette (Freiburg).

You are expected to have a masters degree (or equivalent) in mathematics, or to obtain such a degree before the starting date of the PhD project. A working proficiency in English is necessary, however knowledge of French or German is not required.

To apply, please send the following documents to Andriy Haydys andriy(dot)haydys(AT)ulb.be as a single PDF-file:
Letter of motivation, no longer than 2 pages, providing information about your mathematical interests.
CV.
A brief description of masters thesis (or any project that you may have carried out) and the master thesis itself (draft if not yet ready).
The names and e-mail addresses of two referees.
Copies of degrees / university transcripts or a list of all master courses taken (including grades, when available).
There is no deadline, however it is recommended to apply before 31.05.2023. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis.
