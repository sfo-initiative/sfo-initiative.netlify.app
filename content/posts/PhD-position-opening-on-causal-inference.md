PhD position opening to work on causal inference, in the context of time to
event/survival analysis under the direction of Dr Julie Josse, INRIA, and jointly with Dr Bernard
Sebastien from the ‘Data, Data Science’ department of Sanofi R&D, France. The project will include
applications of causal inference to observational studies. The following aspects will be studied:
• influence of missing data and censoring
• identification of heterogeneous treatment effects
• identification of optimal policies (Dynamic Treatment Regime)
• change in distributions (transportability methods)
The methodological work could be complemented by the development of a dedicated R package.
Applicants should have strong knowledge in Statistics or Machine Learning and experience in R is
required.
