Description: Master Thesis - TEXtile integrated HYbrid Printed Electronics
---


Your future responsibilities
The Electronic Sensors Lab focuses on the design of beyond state-of-the-art electronic read out concepts and circuits for custom made sensors.
 
The master thesis is part of the FFG funded project TEX-Hype (TEXtile integrated HYbrid Printed Electronics, TEX-hype (ffg.at)) which aims at the development of novel technologies for smart textiles enabling seamless integration of electronics and sensors into garment and develop remote patient monitoring system.
The work focuses on the project task for developing  Machine Learning models at the edge using Edge AI and Tiny ML for the signal analysis of a textile-based breath rate sensor. 

The scope of the project includes the following aspects: 

    Data logging of the textile-based breath rate sensor.
    Development and training of a ML model on a popular framework (e.g. TensorFlow Lite) with the prospect of embedding it on the Edge (i.e. MCUs).
    Test & validation of the developed solution.

Your profile

    Master student in Electrical Engineering or similar discipline.
    Fundamental knowledge of Machine Learning & data processing.
    Experience with MCUs & PCB design software is a plus.
    Highly enthusiastic and motivated, willing to learn new technologies.
    Self-organized and target-oriented working style.
    Good communications skills, fluency in English, both written and spoken.
