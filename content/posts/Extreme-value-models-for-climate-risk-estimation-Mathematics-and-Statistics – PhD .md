The University of Exeter’s Department of Mathematics and Statistics is inviting applications for a fully-funded PhD studentship to commence on 25th September 2023 (although earlier or later start dates can be considered). 

For eligible students the studentship will cover Home tuition fees plus an annual tax-free stipend of at least £17,668 for 3.5 years full-time, or pro rata for part-time study.  The student would be based in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in the Faculty of Environment, Science and Economy at the Streatham Campus in Exeter.

Project Description:

Statistical models developed with extreme value theory as a basis allow us to use established mathematics to make probabilistic risk estimates, such as for rare weather events.

For example, we can take data and estimate 1-in-100 year events, and their uncertainty. This can even be done with fewer than 100 years worth of data. Since they can cause considerable damage, it is fortunate that extreme events are by definition rare. Unfortunately, from a statistical perspective, this means data quantifying such events are usually scarce. This project aims to develop models that better use data to improve our understanding of rare weather events.

Statistical modelling of extremes has seen a step change in methodology for representing spatial processes over the last 20 years; see, e.g., Davison and Gholamrezaee (2012), for a review. This is statistically important because with these models we can pool data from multiple locations and partially compensate for data scarcity, when compared to considering each location on its own. Further recent developments, such as Engelke et al. (2018), bring models for extreme events that can extrapolate to higher resolutions than the resolution of the data we have. Advances in resolution of data from numerical weather simulation models may yet be insufficient to give accurate weather risk estimates for some phenomena, but we can now consider using these data with extreme value models to make higher-resolution prediction with the potential to significantly improve risk estimation.

This project will develop a novel statistical framework that incorporates extreme value theory and geostatistics for modelling processes at the higher-resolutions necessary for risk estimation (Youngman, 2019). This will require incorporating efficiencies to make tractable the modelling of Big Data, such as gridded environmental data covering large regions. Complex dependencies must be expected in such data, which will be captured through deep Gaussian processes and generalised additive models (Youngman, 2020). This project will combine developing statistical models with producing user-friendly software for fitting the models. The proposed framework could benefit a considerable number of end-users, and ultimately bring new, quantitative understanding of risk for a variety of types of extreme weather.

This award provides annual funding to cover Home tuition fees and a tax-free stipend.  For students who pay Home tuition fees the award will cover the tuition fees in full, plus at least £17,668 per year tax-free stipend.

The studentship will be awarded on the basis of merit for 3.5 years of full-time study to commence on or around 25th September 2023. International applicants need to be aware that you will have to cover the cost of your student visa, healthcare surcharge and other costs of moving to the UK to do a PhD.

The conditions for eligibility of home fees status are complex and you will need to seek advice if you have moved to or from the UK (or Republic of Ireland) within the past 3 years or have applied for settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme
Entry requirements

Applicants for this studentship must have obtained, or be about to obtain, a First or Upper Second Class UK Honours degree, or the equivalent qualifications gained outside the UK, in Mathematics and/or Statistics, or a closely related subject.

If English is not your first language you will need to meet the required level (Profile A) as per our guidance at https://www.exeter.ac.uk/pg-research/apply/english/
How to apply

In the application process you will be asked to upload several documents. 

• CV

• Letter of application (outlining your academic interests, prior research experience and reasons for wishing to undertake the project).

• Transcript(s) giving full details of subjects studied and grades/marks obtained (this should be an interim transcript if you are still studying)

• Names of two referees familiar with your academic work. You are not required to obtain references yourself. We will request references directly from your referees if you are shortlisted.

• If you are not a national of a majority English-speaking country you will need to submit evidence of your proficiency in English.

The closing date for applications is midnight on 14th February 2023. 

Interviews can be held virtually or on the University of Exeter Streatham Campus in the week commencing 6th March 2023.
