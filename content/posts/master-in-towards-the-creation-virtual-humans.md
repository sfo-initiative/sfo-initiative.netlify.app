## Position context

Type of offer: Masters/Research Masters
Location: Rennes
Research topic: Perception, animation, virtual reality
Project: VIRTUS
Contact person: Katja Zibrek, Yuliya Patotskaya, Ludovic Hoyet
 
## Subject
In recent years, we have seen a significant development in creating digital doubles and characters who closely resemble real humans [1]. Creating believable behaviour and animation for these virtual humans has remained challenging, especially when applied to photorealistic characters [2]. In this research project, we will be exploring the animation qualities of photorealistic virtual humans. It has been shown that character movement can be perceived as attractive, significantly affecting users’ behaviour towards them [3]. Creating appealing characters and their impact on the users will be the central subject of our study.
The objective of this research is to identify which aspects of the character animation affect the user’s perception and interaction with the character (agent). First, the intern will work with motion caption from real person and retarget them on virtual characters. Furthermore, we would like to explore the techniques to edit the animations to manipulate the style of motion[4][5] for realistic characters[1].
The design will be validated by conducting perceptual studies, particularly by harnessing the power of VR which allows the measure of behavioural responses of the users to virtual people, while our findings will be used to advance further research and provide design guidelines for a wider spread application for entertainment, training and rehabilitation. 

## Tasks
The intern will first familiarise with the equipment for animating a virtual human: state-of-the-art facial and body capture procedures and technology to create the virtual characters. Based on the research interest of the intern, different tasks will be available during this internship:
-Environment and agent creation in VR
-Animation techniques
-Motion capture data retargeting on virtual characters
-Designing a perceptual experiment in VR

The intern will work closely with the lead researchers to complete the selected tasks.

## Requirements
The candidate should have:
-Sufficient programming background (C# preferred)
-Interest in character animation and game (virtual reality) development
-Previous knowledge of Unity is a preferred
-Basic knowledge of animation editing tools (e.g., Maya)
-Good level of English is required.
