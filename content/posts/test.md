The International Max Planck Research School for Molecular Plant Science(IMPRS MolPlant) is a doctoral programme in plant science at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology and the University of Potsdam. We are located close to Berlin, the multicultural capital of Germany. Currently, we are inviting applications for Doctoral Positions. Doctoral candidates (f/m/d) and their research projects will start in second half of 2023, between June and December.

Our research: Plants and their seeds are vital for human nutrition. In our IMPRS, we study genetic, molecular, cellular, metabolic and physiological processes of plant growth, development, reproduction and interaction with other organisms. In a plantâ€™s life, interactions occur at multiple levels: among others, between its plastids and the nuclear genome, between cells in one organ, between its roots and above-ground organs, with related plant species and their genomes, with microbes and other biota, and with abiotic environmental factors.

We seek to understand how plants perceive and integrate the multitude of endogenous and exogenous signals they receive to ensure their health, survival, biomass acquisition and seed formation. We work with various plant and algal species, and follow an interdisciplinary approach, combining molecular biology, genetics, genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, biochemistry, biophysics and microscopy with bioinformatics and modelling. Detailed information on the research in the IMPRS groups can be found on the website of the IMPRS MolPlant.
