Description:
The AIMS Structured Master’s Program runs over three semesters. The requisite skills phase of the AIMS course builds a standard core set of problem-solving skills: estimation, computation, approximation, modelling, data analysis and statistics. The elective review phase allows students to apply these skills in some of the most exciting areas of science.

During the final phase of the AIMS course students do a research project and write a scientific report under the supervision of an expert researcher on a topic of their choice. Research initiated in these projects often develops into further postgraduate research work after AIMS.

## Why Apply:
-Renowned lecturers from Africa and worldwide, supported by a team of resident tutors.
-Students and lecturers live on campus to encourage a 24-hour learning environment.
-Group work and highly interactive learning setting.
-Emphasis on programming and Data Science with 24/7 access to computer labs and high-speed internet.
-A diverse student body from across Africa.
-Candidates are highly employable and quickly join higher learning institutions upon graduation
