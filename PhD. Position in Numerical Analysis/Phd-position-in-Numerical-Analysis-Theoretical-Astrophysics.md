We announce a Ph.D. position in the area 'Computational Astrophysics'    

at the University of Vienna, Austria, funded by the

Austrian Science Fund (FWF) for an initial period of 2 years with

possible extension for at least a third year.

 

The successful applicant (m/f/d) will work at the research platform

MMM "Mathematics-Magnetism-Materials" (mmm.univie.ac.at)

c/o Fak. Mathematik Univ.Wien, as a member of the

ACORE group (https://acore.univie.ac.at/) on numerical methods and

computer simulations for magnetohydrodynamics of the solar surface,

in particular on developing the ANTARes code. 

 

The successful applicant is expected to

 

- Develop and implement new numerical methods for

  Computational (Magneto) Hydro Dynamics,

  e.g. Operator splitting methods and (symplectic) time integrators,

- Apply them in large-scale, highly parallelized simulations of the

  solar surface,

- Visualize and interpret the results

 

Candidates interested in this position hold a master's degree in applied

mathematics,  computational sciences, computational physics or a

master's degree in (astro)physics with focus on numerical mathematics

and scientific computing. Experience in numerical modelling and

programming skills in either C/C++ or Fortran are expected.

 

The candidate should be eligible for a doctoral study in natural

sciences/mathematics at the University of Vienna.

 

Candidates must already be authorized to work in the EU.

The application by e-mail contains the following attachements:

 

a) 1/2 page motivation letter

b) 1 page CV, with a report on university credits

c) a proof of language skills, if not native speakers of English or German

d) a summary of research work (including publications)

e) names of two scientists willing to write a recommendation letter

 

Applications are sent to the PI of the project at othmar@othmar-koch.org

 

Applications are welcome until the position is filled.

 

Othmar Koch (Wolfgang Pauli Institute Vienna),

Friedrich Kupka (Univ. Appl. Sciences Technikum Wien & WPI), and

Norbert Mauser (MMM c/o Fak. Mathematik Univ. Wien).
